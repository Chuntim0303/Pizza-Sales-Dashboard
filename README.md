### About Data
The dashboard is constructed using four datasets: order_details, orders, pizza types, and pizzas.

### Highlights

- In July, the total revenue accounted for 8.87% of the overall revenue. With a staggering total revenue, July recorded the highest earnings, surpassing October, which had the lowest total revenue by an impressive 13.32%.
- In the time analysis, the hours between 1200 to 1400 and 1700 to 1900 are identified as the peak hours, indicating high sales activity during these periods. To optimize promotional and marketing efforts, it is advisable to focus on the time slots with lower sales, as they present potential opportunities for increased customer engagement and revenue growth.
- The top 3 most popular pizza categories are the Thai Chicken Pizza, the Barbeque Chicken Pizza, and the California Chicken Pizza. These pizzas have garnered significant customer attention and are among the most sought-after choices in the menu.
- Size L (Large) leads with $375,000 in sales, making up approximately 44.12% of the total pizza sales. On the other hand, sizes XL and XXL have relatively low sales percentages. This may indicate an opportunity to explore strategies to promote these larger sizes or to assess the demand for them more accurately.
- The price distribution per order analysis provides valuable insights into the company's pricing strategy and revenue distribution. It reveals that the price range from $20 to $25 is the most popular among customers and contributes significantly to the overall revenue. Moreover, customer segmentation analysis based on their spending patterns across different price ranges can further refine the understanding of customer behavior and preferences. With this information, the company can tailor its marketing and promotional efforts to target each customer segment effectively.
